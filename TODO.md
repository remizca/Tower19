# Project TODO

This file mirrors the managed todo list and acts as the project's on-disk tracker. Keep this file updated as work progresses.

## Overall Checklist

## Notes
- The first item (high-level outline) was completed and is recorded in `README.md` and `docs/`.
- Use the `manage_todo_list` tool (or update this file) whenever you change task statuses so the in-memory and on-disk trackers stay in sync.
